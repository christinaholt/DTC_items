# Each of the following variables are typically set in the Rocoto XML script. 
# Sourcing this file before running the graphics is helpful if you are not running with Rocoto

# ROTDIR is the input top dir. for the graphics package (output from model). 
# MOAD_DATAROOT is the output top dir. for the graphics package (output from graphics). 
# START_TIME is the analysis time
# FORECAST_TIME is the forecast time in 3 digit format
# GRID_VX_LIST controls the grids that are provided. Possible values are glob, G104, G218. 
#     Input file will be regridded to the NCEP Predefined grid if the item has a leading "G". 
#     NCEP Grids must be defined in regrib.py
#     New map projections are defined in basemaps in make_basemap.def_bm
#     Available values include: 
#         glob          -- plots the input file directly
#         G104          -- NCEP G104: NPS CONUS
#         G218          -- NCEP G218: CONUS 12km Lambert
#         G3            -- NCEP G3: Global 1 deg lat/lon
#         nh_mill       -- Original grid, NH
#         sh_mill       -- Original grid, SH
#         trop_mill     -- Original grid, Trop
#         nps           -- Original grid, full NPS projection
#         sps           -- Original grid, full SPS projection
